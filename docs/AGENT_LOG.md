## 2026-11-11: initial MVP (human-directed session)

* Built the MVP on branch `mvp`: sell-to-close, exits, data providers, baseline strategy, engine,
  runner, dashboard. 140 tests pass.
* Found and fixed while testing: a routine reconcile refreshed `updated_at` on resting orders, which
  would have prevented stale-order cancellation.
* Added a same-underlying/direction concentration limit after a demo run piled five QQQ puts into one
  name.
* Not verified: any real broker, any real market data, performance on anything but a synthetic
  random-walk market (where the baseline loses money, as expected).
